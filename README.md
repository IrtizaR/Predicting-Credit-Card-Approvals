## Description
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. 

## Project Objective and Scope
This project was a part of my certification in Data Scientist with Python from DataCamp career path. The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Approval dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/27/credit+approval) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
